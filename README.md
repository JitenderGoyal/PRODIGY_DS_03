# Bank Marketing Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Bank Marketing dataset, applying various machine learning models to predict customer behavior, and performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to predict whether a customer will purchase a bank product.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset. It includes customer demographic and account information, along with whether they subscribed to a term deposit, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Features of the Dataset
- Customer demographics and account information.
- The target variable indicates whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Components
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling features using StandardScaler.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical summary and analysis of missing values.
   - Distribution plots for key features.
   - Bar plots for categorical features.
   - Pair plots and box plots for visualizing relationships.
   - Correlation matrix heatmap.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Logistic Regression
   - Evaluation using accuracy scores and classification reports.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Visualizing important features for Random Forest and Decision Tree models.

5. **Decision Tree Visualization**:
   - Simplified visualization of the Decision Tree model.

## Usage
This project can be used as a reference for similar data analysis and machine learning tasks, especially those involving classification problems in the banking sector.
